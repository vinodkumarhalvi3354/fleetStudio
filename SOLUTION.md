 # Solution Overview

This is a proposed web-based application, which is planned to be full-stack and intended for showcasing the code differences in response to a particular commit pulled from a relevant open source GitHub repository. Primarily, frontend is developed with the help of React while backend is developed using Node. js and Express, involving with GitHub API to request the commit information. The application shows commit information and a diff of the adjustments in the committed files.

## Architectural Decisions

### Technology Choices

1. **Frontend: React**
- **Reasoning:** The above diagram show that, React provide a strong component structure to manage states and render UIs. Its ecosystem provides many libraries for routing, state, and asynchronous operations’ handling.

2. **Backend: Node. js and Express**
- **Reasoning:** Node. js is also suitable for creating RESTful APIs since such an application’s I/O model is non-blocking. Express is a micro web application framework that makes routing as well as middleware easy to handle.

3. **API Communication: Axios**
- **Reasoning:** It is an advanced HTTP client for Node.js based on the promises and comes with a simple interface for making HTTP requests. This was done because of its simplicity of its usage coupled with compatibility with both Node. js and React.

4. **Data Fetching: GitHub API**
- **Reasoning:** Despite the above-mentioned issues, the access to the repository information and switch between commit history and file diffs is provided by the GitHub API. It works with REST and GraphQL and provides the ability to choose the method of working with data.

### Design Patterns

- **Modularization:** The project is divided into two modules; the Frontend and Backend to enhance modularization and subsequent reuse in the case of any issues.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** People get to employ react components in an effort meant to help in organizing and systematizing the UI logic.

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting:** GitHub API is has rate limit properties, meaning that it has limitations of how many requests can be made in a certain amount of time. This limitation may pose problems in data fetching when multiple users are actively using the application.

2. **Lack of Advanced Error Handling:** The I/O handling at this point in time only has simple error handling. In the production environment, more detailed error handling would be required in order to log those messages and display friendly error messages.

3. **No Authentication:** They don’t enable GitHub OAuth authentication in this application; it means that data fetch capacity of private repositories is limited. OAuth put in place would help warrant authentication and provide the user with a chance to view some private data.

4. **Limited UI Features:** It has a very simple interface now and lacks aesthetical refinement, although it is rather utilitarian. The primary reason could be the lack of time that prevented making more clean design with good animations and more appropriate responsive layouts.

## Future Improvements

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Introduce GitHub OAuth to let users sign in to share their info and use private repositories.

2. **Advanced Error Handling and Logging:** They included improving error handling so that errors can be well handled , and adding a logging system for errors gotten during the execution of the program. This would make the codes easier to maintain and easier to debug.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements:** Enhance the appearance of the application and interface with better user interface, better layouts and application animations. This would improve the interaction and attractiveness of the application to the particular users.

4. **Unit and Integration Testing:** Include integration of the functional tests using testing frameworks such as Jest and Cypress for frontend & backend components stability & reliability.

5. **Performance Optimization:** Apply caching techniques to decrease the number of API call and also use service like redis.

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** CI/CD – Automate the processes of testing, building, and deployment for better and streamlined updates and maintenance of the software.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a full-stack application that interacts with the GitHub API to display commit data and code diffs. The chosen technologies and design decisions aimed to provide a modular, scalable, and easy-to-maintain codebase. While there are some known limitations, the foundation has been laid for further enhancements and features. Future improvements can be made to enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of the application.
